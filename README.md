This is an example react project that is migrating from javacript to typescript.

To add TypeScript to a Create React App project, first install it:

```
npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
# or
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

Next, rename any file to be a TypeScript file (e.g. src/index.js to src/index.tsx) and restart your development server!

Type errors will show up in the same console as the build one. You'll have to fix these type errors before you continue development or build your project. For advanced configuration, [see here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration)
